# Defect ledger

Historical tetrguide issues are design
constraints in ROADMAP.md, not fixes claimed by this repository.

Every new fix entry needs symptom, root cause, detection class, instrument and
a named green run. An unrun gate leaves the entry OPEN.

## V-001 — CLOSED: latent geometry survived ambiguous crops

- Symptom: first fixtures (runs/fixtures-r1.stderr.log) failed
  `test_partial_crop_is_unknown_not_latent_truth` and
  `test_accepted_cannot_contain_unknown` (37/39 passed).
- Root cause: renderer transformed latent origin even with missing row/column
  anchors; state accepted a board with no supported lattice.
- Detection class: visibility-contract.
- Instrument: conservative missing-anchor lattice masking; acceptance requires
  geometry; the two named fixtures pin both boundaries.
- Green gate: docs/evidence/fixtures-r3.stderr.log, 44/44; repeated on
  docs/evidence/fixtures-final.stderr.log, 46/46. Both named geometry fixtures green.

## V-002 — CLOSED: indistinguishable layers could receive certain labels

- Symptom: code review found active/locked used the same skin while labels
  trusted latent membership; arbitrary remapped locked types had the same risk.
- Root cause: final-frame identifiability had not been separated from generator
  layer/type knowledge.
- Detection class: visibility-contract.
- Instrument: distinct style conventions for identifiable pilot families;
  matched-pixel active/locked counterexample with equal unknown outputs;
  unsupported remapped types masked independently of occupancy.
- Green gate: docs/evidence/fixtures-r3.stderr.log, 44/44; repeated on
  docs/evidence/fixtures-final.stderr.log, 46/46. The paired-image and unseen-
  palette tests are green; real-frame recoverability remains unmeasured.

## V-003 — CLOSED: copied brief had an incorrect handwritten checksum

- Symptom: checkpoint SHA256 disagreed with Get-FileHash of the byte-exact copy.
- Root cause: checksum was entered manually without comparison to source.
- Detection class: provenance.
- Instrument: evidence script compares copied and supplied bytes and computes
  all recorded checksums, rather than trusting the checkpoint string.
- Green gate: docs/evidence/evidence.json (passed, rc=0), foundation.json records
  the checksum computed after byte-for-byte comparison to the supplied brief.

## V-004 — CLOSED: fixture confused peak accounting with admission

- Symptom: fixtures-r2 had 43/44 green. The 80 MiB Python allocation was denied
  within the 64 MiB Job, yet raw PeakJobMemoryUsed read 108,417,024 B, reding an
  assertion that the historical peak could never exceed the configured limit.
- Root cause: the fixture inferred allocation success from a peak counter.
  The precise Windows accounting cause is not established. The limit readback
  and actual native allocation admission are the contracts we can test directly.
- Detection class: test-instrument.
- Instrument: native VirtualAlloc 4 MiB succeeds / 80 MiB fails under the readback-
  verified 64 MiB ceiling. Preserve raw peak values without clamping them.

- Green gate: docs/evidence/fixtures-r3.stderr.log, 44/44; repeated on
  docs/evidence/fixtures-final.stderr.log, 46/46, including native admission and
  child/grandchild death. Raw accounting behavior remains documented above.
